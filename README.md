# Liquorwebsite
Website Name: The Drink Inn

Description:
It is an e-commerce website where the liquor is sold online. Where it has a registration and a login page which is a step by step process and redirects to the main page where user can view the different liquors  and user can add products to the cart and show the total price of the added products


Yes. The app is finished.

Future Updates:
I would like to add the payment, discounts and coupons section and the age verification procedure.

BUGS AND ISSUES:
As of now there are no issues with the code but if in future when we develop the site, we might get some issues with the non-working support and the page late running issues and the page redirecting things.
